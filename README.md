## Notice: Official Support, Warranty & Hardware Disclaimer

> **A Quick Note Before Flashing or Modifying Firmware**
>
> Thanks to the Tracker's isolated bootloader and hardware emergency recovery button (see [Flashing on Hardware & Emergency Recovery](#4-flashing-on-hardware--emergency-recovery)), experimenting with Community Edition builds is very safe. Even if a custom build fails to boot, you can easily re-flash a stable `.ptf` image from your microSD card. That said, we still need to include the standard legal disclaimer just in case:
>
> * **Provided "AS IS" Without Support Obligation**: While the foundation of this repository was originally developed and released by **Polyend**, the **Polyend Tracker Community Edition (CE)** firmware, source code, and any community-developed modifications or plugins are provided **"AS IS"**, without warranty of any kind, express or implied. **Polyend has no obligation to provide official technical support, maintenance, bug fixes, or customer service** for Community Edition firmware or custom builds.
> * **Use at Your Own Risk**: Flashing, modifying, or running custom firmware is done at your own discretion and risk. Polyend is not liable for any data loss, project corruption, malfunction, or hardware damage (including "bricking" a device or issues caused by code modifications) arising from the use of this software.
> * **Out-of-Warranty Repairs Available**: In the unlikely event that something ever goes wrong with your hardware while using custom firmware, it is **not covered under standard warranty**. However, **Polyend is always happy to help get your instrument back up and running through its official out-of-warranty repair service** (standard service, parts, and shipping fees apply. See [How to Contact Polyend Customer Support](https://backstage.polyend.com/t/how-to-contact-the-polyend-customer-support/15510)).

## Guiding Principles of the Community Edition Firmware

This repository prioritizes workflow continuity: our aim is to respect existing muscle memory, introduce features, optimizations and improvements that fit the original vision of the device, while fixing bugs along the way.

If you have ideas for major workflow adjustments or structural changes, please open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/polyend/tracker-ce/discussions) or a topic on the [Polyend Backstage Forum](https://backstage.polyend.com/) first, so we can align on direction together with the community.

For radical experiments or reimagined interfaces, we actively encourage community forks!

## Contributing

We welcome community contributions! ❤️

From bug fixes and workflow improvements to new open-source synth engines and `.ptfx` Sample Editor plugins. Please read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for our project philosophy, pull request rules, hardware testing workflow, and technical checklist before opening a Pull Request.

## Building Firmware

### 1. Prerequisites
* **[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain `10.3-2021.10`](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm)**:
  * Direct official downloads from Arm:
    * **Linux (`x86_64`)**: [`gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2`](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2)
    * **Linux (`aarch64` / ARM64)**: [`gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-aarch64-linux.tar.bz2`](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-aarch64-linux.tar.bz2)
    * **macOS (`x86_64` / Apple Silicon via Rosetta)**: [`gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-mac.tar.bz2`](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-mac.tar.bz2)
    * **Windows (ZIP)**: [`gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-win32.zip`](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10-win32.zip)
  * Ensure `arm-none-eabi-gcc` is on your `PATH`, extract the toolchain into `./agt/10.3/`, or pass `TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/arm-none-eabi-` to `make`.
* `make` (for building firmware) and `python3` (used by `make ptfx` to package `.ptfx` Sample Editor plugins and by the `make bump-*` version helpers; standard library only).

### 2. Build Commands
From the repository root:

```bash
# Build all three devices (Original Tracker, Tracker+, Tracker Mini)
make all

# Or build a single target:
make original   # -> build/PolyendTracker_CE_1.0.0.ptf
make plus       # -> build/TrackerPlus_CE_1.0.0.ptf
make mini       # -> build/TrackerMini_CE_1.0.0.ptf

# Build reference .ptfx Sample Editor effects into editor-fx-sdk/build/Effects/:
make ptfx

# Build open-source .psyn synth (CHIP.psyn) and stage all factory + open-source .psyn plugins into build/Synths/:
make psyn

# Or compile only the synth-plugin-sdk reference plugin (CHIP.psyn -> synth-plugin-sdk/build/):
make -C synth-plugin-sdk

# Clean all build directories:
make clean
```

### 3. Version Management (`version.mk`)
All firmware version numbers are defined in [`version.mk`](version.mk). The **Build** identifier displayed on the hardware under **Config > Firmware > Build** is automatically populated from the short Git commit hash (`git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD`):

```bash
# Show current version, Git build hash & output filenames
make version

# Increment patch version (e.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
make bump-patch TARGET=all        # or TARGET=original | TARGET=plus | TARGET=mini

# Increment minor version (e.g. 1.0.x -> 1.1.0)
make bump-minor TARGET=all        # or TARGET=original | TARGET=plus | TARGET=mini
```

### 4. Flashing on Hardware & Emergency Recovery

1. Copy the generated `.ptf` file from `build/` (`PolyendTracker_*.ptf`, `TrackerPlus_*.ptf`, or `TrackerMini_*.ptf`) to the `/Firmware/` folder on your Tracker's microSD card.
   * *Note*: Keep `.ptf` filenames at **31 characters or fewer** so the Original Tracker's 32-byte `/Firmware/_fwinfo` bootloader buffer remains null-terminated.
2. On the device, open **Config > Firmware > Firmware update**, select the `.ptf` file, and confirm.

> **Bootloader Resilience & Emergency Firmware Recovery**:
> * The Polyend Tracker bootloader is isolated from the application firmware:
>   * On the **Original Tracker (`MK66`)**, the bootloader runs on a separate dedicated microcontroller (`kBootloaderTrig`).
>   * On **Tracker+ and Tracker Mini (`IMX`)**, the bootloader resides in a protected region at the bottom of QSPI Flash (`0x60000000`–`0x6002FFFF`), while `.ptf` application builds are linked starting at `0x60030000` (do not modify the flash `ORIGIN` address in the linker scripts).
> * **Emergency Recovery**: If a custom firmware build ever hangs or fails to boot into the UI, you can always recover your device:
>   1. Place a known-good, stable `.ptf` firmware file for your device inside the `/Firmware/` folder on your microSD card (ideally as the only `.ptf` file in `/Firmware/`).
>   2. Insert the microSD card into your Tracker and power it on.
>   3. Use a paperclip or SIM-eject pin to press the **recessed hardware Reset / Emergency Bootloader pinhole button** (located on the bottom of the Original Tracker / Tracker+, or next to the USB-C port on Tracker Mini). The hardware bootloader will automatically pick up the `.ptf` file from `/Firmware/` and flash it.
